● Perfect! Thank you for the clarification. Now I understand completely:

  ✅ Correct Game Mechanics

  Starting State:
  - Deck: 52 cards (standard deck)
  - Deal: 6 cards/player (3 hand + 3 reserves) × 2 players = 12 cards
  - Discard pile: 1 card placed
  - Deck at start: 52 - 12 - 1 = 39 cards ✓ (matches your logs!)

  Gameplay:
  - After playing cards, draw back to 3 in hand (if deck has cards)
  - When deck empty AND hand empty → play reserves
  - Win: hand=0 AND reserves=0

  Special Cards:
  - 2 (Wild): Play on anything, anything plays on it
  - 7 (Low Enforcer): Next player must play ≤7
  - 10 (Burner): Removes pile from game

  📋 CORRECTED Optimized Delta Protocol Design

  Field Codes (Final - Corrected)

  | Code | Meaning           | Example    | Delta?                             |
  |------|-------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
  | h    | hand              | h=3D,TD,7S | ✅ Always (changes every turn)      |
  | r    | reserves          | r=2        | ✅ Delta (only when changed)        |
  | oh   | opponent_hand     | oh=3       | ✅ Always (changes every turn)      |
  | or   | opponent_reserves | or=2       | ✅ Delta (only when changed)        |
  | on   | opponent_name     | on=Bob     | ❌ Full state only                  |
  | tc   | top_card          | tc=5H      | ✅ Always (changes every turn)      |
  | dp   | discard_pile_size | dp=8       | ✅ Always (changes every turn)      |
  | dk   | deck_size         | dk=35      | ✅ Delta (only when cards drawn)    |
  | ml   | must_play_low     | ml=1       | ✅ Delta (only when 7 played/reset) |
  | yt   | your_turn         | yt=1       | ✅ Always (turn switches)           |

  Message Examples (CORRECTED)

  1. GAME_STATE_FULL (106) - Game Start

  Player 1 (goes first):
  106|1||h=3D,TD,7S|r=3|oh=3|or=3|on=Bob|tc=5H|dp=1|dk=39|ml=0|yt=1
  65 bytes

  Player 2 (waits):
  106|2||h=AH,2C,AS|r=3|oh=3|or=3|on=Alice|tc=5H|dp=1|dk=39|ml=0|yt=0
  67 bytes

  ---
  2. TURN_UPDATE (113) - You Play Single Card (Draw 1)

  Scenario: You play 7S (enforces low), draw AC from deck

  To you:
  113|1||h=3D,TD,AC|tc=7S|dp=2|dk=38|ml=1|yt=0
  37 bytes - New hand (drew AC), top card, pile grew, deck shrunk, low rule active, turn switches

  To opponent:
  113|2||oh=3|tc=7S|dp=2|ml=1|yt=1
  27 bytes - Opponent hand stayed 3 (played 1, drew 1), top card, pile grew, low rule, your turn

  ---
  3. TURN_UPDATE (113) - Opponent Plays 2 (Wild)

  Scenario: Opponent plays 2H (wild card)

  To you:
  113|1||oh=3|tc=2H|dp=3|yt=1
  22 bytes - Opponent hand count, new top (2 wild), pile grew, your turn
  - Note: ml not sent because it didn't change (still 0)
  - Note: dk not sent because opponent drew 1 to replace 1 (net 0)

  ---
  4. TURN_UPDATE (113) - You Play 10 (Burner)

  Scenario: You play 10H (burns entire pile), draw KD

  To you:
  113|1||h=3D,7S,KD|tc=1S|dp=0|dk=37|yt=0
  36 bytes - New hand, special empty indicator (1S), pile burned, deck shrunk, turn switches

  To opponent:
  113|2||oh=3|tc=1S|dp=0|yt=1
  21 bytes - Pile burned, fresh start

  ---
  5. TURN_UPDATE (113) - You Pickup 8-Card Pile (No Draw)

  Scenario: No valid play, pickup pile

  To you:
  113|1||h=3D,TD,7S,5H,6H,2C,AS,KD,QH,9D,4C|dp=0|ml=0|yt=0
  52 bytes - Hand grew (no draw from deck), pile emptied, low rule reset

  To opponent:
  113|2||oh=11|dp=0|ml=0|yt=1
  20 bytes

  ---
  6. TURN_UPDATE (113) - Playing from Reserve (Deck Empty)

  Scenario: Your hand empty, deck empty, play reserve → reveals 4H (valid)

  To you:
  113|1||h=|r=2|tc=4H|dp=2|yt=0
  23 bytes - Empty hand, reserves decreased, top card changed

  To opponent:
  113|2||or=2|tc=4H|dp=2|yt=1
  21 bytes - Opponent reserves decreased

  ---
  7. TURN_UPDATE (113) - Opponent Plays Multiple Cards

  Scenario: Opponent plays 3H,3D,3C (3 of same rank), draws 3 cards

  To you:
  113|1||oh=3|tc=3H|dp=5|dk=34|yt=1
  29 bytes - Opponent hand (played 3, drew 3 = still 3), top card, pile +3, deck -3

  ---
  8. GAME_STATE_FULL (106) - Reconnection Mid-Game

  Scenario: Deck low, you have 1 card in hand, 1 reserve

  106|1||h=4D|r=1|oh=5|or=2|on=Bob|tc=QS|dp=15|dk=12|ml=0|yt=1
  55 bytes - Complete state restoration

  Average savings: ~80% 🚀

  Delta Send Logic (When to Include Each Field)

  Always Send in TURN_UPDATE:

  - ✅ h or oh - Hand always relevant
  - ✅ tc - Top card always changes (or burns)
  - ✅ dp - Pile size always changes
  - ✅ yt - Turn always switches

  Conditional Send (only when changed):

  - dk - Only when cards drawn from deck
  - ml - Only when 7 played (set to 1) or reset to 0
  - r or or - Only when reserves played
  - on - Never in delta (only in full state)
